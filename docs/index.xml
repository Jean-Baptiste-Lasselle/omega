      <description>Pourquoi Omega ? As I was working on a software that had to send e-mails, based on beautiful templates. I found MJML, a markup language designed and standardized by MailJet, and I soon found a wysiwyg MJML editor, GrapesJS. Using that software which could allow my software users to edit new email templates for their mailing campaigns, all on their own. Only problem here is that GrapesJS does not support peristence to files, on a private infrastructure, out of the box.</description>
